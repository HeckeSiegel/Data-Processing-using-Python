# Data-Processing-using-Python
Computational tools and optimization techniques for processing measurement data of atmospheric trace gas concentrations using Pyhton.
Including basic techniques like: linear least square problems, curve fitting and regression, regularization techniques, 
weighted and total least squares, sampling and interpolation, nonlinear optimization and search methods.
All projects work independent of each other.
